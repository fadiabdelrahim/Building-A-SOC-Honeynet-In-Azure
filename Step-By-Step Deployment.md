# <p align="center"> Building A SOC + Honeynet in Azure (Live Traffic) </br> Step-By-Step Deployment

## Introduction

This project aims to set up a comprehensive Cloud Honeynet integrated with a Security Operations Center (SOC) using Microsoft Azure services. The objective is to deploy a virtualized environment that simulates a vulnerable cloud infrastructure, which is then monitored for security incidents using Microsoft Sentinel. The project provides hands-on experience with setting up cloud resources, configuring security monitoring tools, and analyzing security logs to detect and respond to potential threats.

This project is divided into several parts, starting with the creation of cloud resources in Azure, configuring logging and monitoring using Microsoft Sentinel, and ending with securing the cloud environment based on best practices and compliance standards.
